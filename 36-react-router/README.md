# React Router

## Outline

* BrowserRouter
  * Wrap whole application
* Switch
  * Should wrap all of routes- provided we want them to be rendered one at a time
* Route
  * Which maps a path (url) to a specifict component
* Link
  * Which allows a user to navigate between routes
* `this.props.history.push`
  * Programmatically redirect the user
* `this.props.match.params.<variable name>`
  * Used to get variables from the route
